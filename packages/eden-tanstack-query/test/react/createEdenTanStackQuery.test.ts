/**
 * Tests for createEdenTanStackQuery
 *
 * The createEdenTanStackQuery factory is a thin wrapper around createEdenContext.
 * Its functionality is tested as part of the React Context tests in:
 *
 * @see ./context.test.tsx - Tests for EdenProvider, useEden, useEdenClient
 *
 * The factory simply re-exports the context utilities and may include
 * additional helpers in the future (SSR utils, prefetch helpers, etc.)
